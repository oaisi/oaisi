**Weekly Co-Working Sessions**

We're running co-working sessions *weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays* for the rest of term! 



We're providing a space for focus, accountability, and community. Come along to work on any safety-related projects you're doing - these sessions are designed to allow you a place to really focus on AI safety without distraction from all the other things you've got going on. There'll be drinks, snacks, and somebody to talk to if you need to work through ideas!
