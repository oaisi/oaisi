			>I'm Rohan, a second-year undergraduate studying PPE at Merton.<br
			/>In the past I've worked with Daniel Kokotajlo's team developing
			concrete scenarios about what AI developments over the next five
			years might mean for the world, and currently I'm spending some time
			thinking about how we can reduce the risks of malevolent actors
			misusing future generations of frontier AI models.<br />I'd be
			excited to chat about what policy & governance levers seem most
			promising, and to get a better understanding of the theories of
			victory are from different approaches in technical alignment.

			>Hi, I’m James, a first-year MPhil in Economics at Balliol.<br />I did my undergrad, also in Economics, at the other place, where I found out about AI safety and catastrophic risk through the uni’s effective altruism community. Through the ERA:AI fellowship, I pursued a project on “risk compensation in AI deployment” – the possibility that safety-promoting measures might have limited effect if they incentivise greater or more reckless deployment of new models. Aside from that, I’ve done short projects on modelling AI’s effect on the labour market for software engineers and considering the possibility for “races to the bottom” between AI evals orgs, drawing on the auditing literature.<br />At OAISI, I help run programmes which introduce people to these ideas. Please reach out to chat about anything that takes your fancy!

			>Hi, I'm Louis! I'm in my masters year doing Computer Science and
			Philosophy at Oxford, and my main interests include AI [control /
			safety / ethics], game theory, and cooperative AI. I've previously
			worked on the following projects (in order of recency): cooperation
			and alignment in multi-agent games (current project); AI-Control
			games; behavioural evaluations of deception in LLMs; and active
			learning in LLMs.<br />I'm always up for talking about all things
			CS, philosophy (particularly AI-relevant topics but also continental
			philosophy), and other entirely-not-work-related stuff like music
			and games!

			Hi, I'm Nick! I'm a third-year CS and Philosophy student. I'm
			interested in a bunch of areas in AI safety - I've done some
			mechanistic interpretability and priorities work previously. I'm a
			research assistant in the Human Information Processing lab here in
			Oxford, and I run [orchard], a group for people to work on their
			passion projects. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about
			AI safety, philosophy, or anything else!

			>Hiya, I'm Gracie. I've just graduated in Psychology and Philosophy
			at Oxford where I generally focussed on AI, consciousness, and
			ethics. Within AI safety, I've generally taken on operations roles
			and have worked at OAISI since my first year of university (when we
			were still OxAI's SGT) as well as working at the Cambridge AI Safety
			Hub and ARENA. I've carried out research into philosophical theories
			of alignment, inductive bias, critical thinking, and the
			non-identity problem. I'm always around for a chat and very up for
			meeting new people, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to get
			to know OAISI a little better!
