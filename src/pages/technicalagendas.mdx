**Technical Agendas Reading Group**

[Sign up](https://airtable.com/appYLUyQifgR31gwq/pag32YVqf6OjfHKx3/form) by **January 22nd**

This group will meet weekly to read and discuss key papers in a variety of technical AI safety research agendas. The exact agendas we choose to read will be decided based on the shared interests of the group.

The sessions will likely run for 2hrs at a time to accommodate time for both reading and discussion. The exact time/location will be coordinated once the group has been formed. We'll provide snacks!


We expect the members of this group to have some background technical AI safety knowledge and an interest in working in the field. We have therefore created an application form. The form is very short, we just want to develop an brief understanding of how much you already know.
