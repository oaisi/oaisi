If you'd like to apply for or attend something that is closed, let us know! It may be that we still have space and you can join late, it may be that we'll be running it again very soon. [Fill this in](https://airtable.com/appYLUyQifgR31gwq/pagJPbstuT1RAzuNb/form) and we'll let you know.

This group will meet weekly to read and discuss the key papers from a number of different technical AI safety research agendas (e.g. control, GSAI). The goal is to understand the core assumptions underpinning current approaches and to understand the cases when a particular agenda no longer makes sense.

The sessions will likely run for 2hrs at a time. We'll run a poll to determine exact time/location will be coordinated once the group has been formed. We'll provide snacks!


We expect the members of this group to have some background technical AI safety knowledge and an interest in working in the field.
