In Summer 2024, the former OxAI Safety and Governance team decided to spin out into an independent organisation: OAISI, the Oxford AI Safety Initiative. (We pronounce it *oh-ay-see*.)

We hold that:
1. The AI safety community - particularly at the undergraduate level - at Oxford would benefit from an organisation specifically trying to support research and education in AI safety here.
2. There are many people who are highly capable of working on AI safety in Oxford who haven't yet been introduced to the field or aren't working on it.

OAISI's role is to:
1. Support the existing community, increasing the productivity, experience, and quality and quantity of conversations and projects concerning AI safety.
2. Introduce new talent - primarily Oxford students - to the field, and provide structure and support in building their skills.

If you're in Oxford, and would like to join our community, reach out to us [here](mailto:gracie@oaisi.org)
