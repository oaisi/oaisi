## About

In Summer 2024, the former OxAI Safety and Governance team decided to spin out
into an independent organisation: OAISI, the Oxford AI Safety Initiative. (We
pronounce it _oh-ay-see_.)

We hold that:

1. The AI safety community - particularly at the undergraduate level - at Oxford
   would benefit from an organisation specifically trying to support research
   and education in AI safety here.
2. There are many people who are highly capable of working on AI safety in
   Oxford who haven't yet been introduced to the field or aren't working on it.

OAISI's role is to:

1. Support the existing community, increasing the productivity, experience, and
   quality and quantity of conversations and projects concerning AI safety.
2. Introduce new talent - primarily Oxford students - to the field, and provide
   structure and support in building their skills.

AI safety is a sociotechnical issue: we support both governance and technical
work, and we run programmes to build skills in both.

If you're in Oxford, and would like to join our community, reach out to us
