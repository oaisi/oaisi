**Strategy Fellowship**

This is a call to apply to be a participant or a facilitator for the first OAISI Strategy Fellowship. Over 6 weeks, we'll discuss key strategic parameters to help you develop your approach to AI risk.

- A **6 week** reading group, from Week 3 to 8 of Michaelmas '24
- 2 hours commitment per week
- Exploring timelines, scaling, institutions and technical approaches in AI safety

Target audience:
- Those **currently working on technical AI safety or AI governance**, who want to understand how their work interacts with timelines and other strategic parameters
- Students and researchers who have only a little familiarity with the field of AI safety and want to **understand the various approaches in a principled way**

Content (subject to change):
- *Timelines and scaling*: the scaling hypothesis; biological anchors, the direct approach; trends in compute; takeoff models
- *Threat models*: what are the labs trying to build?; takeover; the difficulty of alignment
- *The state of play*: the chip supply chain; the labsâ€™ plans; the role of researchers
- *Partisan approaches*: Situational Awareness; the difference between the US and China
- *Slowing and containing*: plausibility of slowing; race dynamics
