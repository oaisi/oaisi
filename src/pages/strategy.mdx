**Strategy Fellowship**

This is a call to apply to be a participant or a facilitator for the first OAISI Strategy Fellowship. Over 6 weeks, we'll discuss key strategic parameters to help you develop your views on and approach to AI risk.

- 6 weeks, from Week 3 to 8 of Michaelmas '24
- Exploring timelines, scaling, institutions and technical approaches in AI safety
- Designed for those with some experience thinking about AI or AI safety (e.g. read The Alignment Problem/done the ML course/skimmed a few papers)
- Those with technical experience who want to build a 'bigger picture' of AI safety are particularly encouraged to apply.
