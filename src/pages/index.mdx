- [Projects](projects) (Thursday 7-10pm): work on an AI safety project in a
  group environment (pizza and project ideas provided!)

**Catastrophic risk from advanced artificial intelligence may be the defining
issue of our time.**

OAISI's role is to **support the AI safety community in Oxford**. You can find
out more about our mission [here](about).

If you're an AI safety researcher visiting Oxford, reach out to us
[here](mailto:gracie+visiting@oaisi.org). If you're based in Oxford and want to
reach out, email us [here](mailto:gracie+newmember@oaisi.org).

To get regular updates on what we're doing, sign up to our
[mailing list](http://eepurl.com/i1scNU).

Go to our [get in touch](getintouch) page to book 1-1 sessions with our
committee to chat about AI safety, OAISI, and how you can get involved.
