We're running our flagship **introductory fellowship programme**, allowing selected fellows to explore the strategic, technical and governance issues posed by advanced AI systems. This will (provisionally) replace the [Strategy Fellowship](strategy) run in Michaelmas 2024, which has similar aims and scope.


Following a **3-3 structure**, our fellows will explore the fundamentals of AI safety for the first three weeks before specialising through either our **technical** or **governance track** for the later three weeks! 

Details:
- Expect to commit 2hrs/week for six weeks (conditional on acceptance into Part II) starting in Week 2
- Each cohort will comprise 5-8 participants, guided by a facilitator. 
- All reading is completed within the session, there is no time commitment outside of the session itself.

Structure:
- The first three weeks (Part I) cover high-level strategic considerations around risks from advanced AI systems.
- The second three weeks (Part II) cover the most promising avenues for risk mitigation, either from a technical or governance perspective. Continuing fellows join the specialist cohorts in Part II based on their background and interests.

We expect to admit participants from a range of backgrounds, including:
- Those with a technical/ML or policy background who want to more deeply understand and evaluate the case for working on extreme risks from AI.
- Those who are concerned by extreme risks from AI, and want to systematically develop their understanding of the field.

**We're also looking for facilitators!**
- Facilitators can choose to facilitate one or both parts of the programme (3 or 6 weeks). We pay all facilitators an hourly rate.
- Facilitators are responsible for arranging meeting times with participants, answering their logistical or follow-up object-level questions on Slack (within reason), and providing printed readings / snacks. Meeting locations tbc.
