Want to gain more experience or have a project you want to work on? Join our AI safety projects group to discover impactful new research, collaborate with others interested in AI safety, and hold yourself accountable.

If you're not sure what to work on already, we're collating a list of impactful projects researchers want to see done but don't have time for. Come to find a group and start researching!

For those already doing safety research, we're providing a co-working space specifically targeted towards those interested in AI safety.
