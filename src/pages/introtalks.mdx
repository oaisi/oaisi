We have both [Orsolya Dobe](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/orsolya-dobe-9ba499163) (Pivotal, ex-OECD) and [Suryansh Mehta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suryansh-mehta/) (Future Impact Group, Longview Philanthropy, ex-Merton) giving a two-part intro to AI safety.

We're excited to have them speak - this talk might be particularly useful undergrads and postgrads interested in (but broadly unfamiliar with) AI safety. See you there!
